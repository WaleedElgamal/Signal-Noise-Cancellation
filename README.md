# Signal-Noise-Cancellation
Signal generation and noise cancellation

The project included 2 parts:

1. Implemented a python script which corresponds to playing random notes from the 3rd and 4th piano octaves.

2. Filtered a contaminated signal to get the original sound without noise using frequency domain conversion.
