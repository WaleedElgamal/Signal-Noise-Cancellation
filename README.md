# Signal-Noise-Cancellation
Signal generation and noise cancellation 
The project included 2 parts: 
The first was immplementing a python script which corresponds to playing random notes from the 3rd and 4th piano octaves.
The second was filtering a contaminated signal to get the original sound without noise using frequency domain conversion.
